# Altair8800viaAVR
I'll be creating a smaller board the will have a mini "mock up" of an Altair 8800.

Design Goals:
1. Use the AVR12828 and add the required I/O via a TM1638.
1. Would be nice to allow it to emulate a PDP-8 also.

Looks like the Blinkenlights is what I am looking for. So I am now making a board that will handle take the Blinkinlights API.
