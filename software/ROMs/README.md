Altair Disk Boot Loader version 4.1
DISASSEMBLED BY MARTIN EBERHARD, 4 MARCH 2012 FROM AN EPROM WITH A PRINTED LABEL THAT SAID 'DBL 4.1'. 

BECAUSE OF THE SLOW EPROM ACCESS TIME, THIS EPROM-BASED PROGRAM FIRST COPIES ITSELF INTO RAM AT ADDRESS 2C00H 
(RUNLOC), AND THEN EXECUTES THERE. ONCE IN RAM, THIS PROGRAM READS FROM THE DISK STARTING AT  
TRACK 00, SECTOR 00. SECTOR DATA (WHICH INCLUDES THE ACTUAL DATA PAYLOAD, AS WELL AS HEADER AND TRAILER BYTES) IS FIRST
LOADED INTO A RAM BUFFER IN MEMORY JUST AFTER THIS PROGRAM. THE DATA PAYLOAD THEN GETS MOVED INTO MEMORY STARTING AT
ADDRESS 0000H (DMAADR), CHECKING THE CHECKSUM ALONG THE WAY.
